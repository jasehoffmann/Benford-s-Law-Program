# Benfords-Law-Program

Developed a Python program to analyze numerical datasets using Benfordâ€™s Law, which predicts the expected frequency distribution of leading digits. The program reads CSV files, calculates observed distributions, compares them to theoretical expectations, and performs a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. It generates a visual plot in the terminal and outputs a detailed CSV report with relevant statistics and digit-level summaries for further analysis. This project has applicability in fields such as forensic accounting and demonstrates how statistical principles can be combined with programming to uncover patterns in real-world data.
